# GStreamer Streaming Tests
In this section, we will perform **streaming tests** first **on PC/Ubuntu 22.04**, then try the similar commands on RZ/G2L with hardware-specific encoder/decoder adjustments. Then We'll test the video streaming from RZ/G2L to PC using GStreamer commands.

### **Basic test**:

First, we can take a look at the simple video test source,

( RZ/G2L )

```
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink
```

![](../img/g04_02.png)

We then perform a simple test to make sure equirectangular filter work properly

( RZ/G2L )

```
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1080 ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert ! autovideosink

```

â€»tip:

Make sure if the X,Y Maps are exist in the folder,

EquimatX, EquimatY

The output screen is as below,

### **Streaming testing**:

We prepare to do a streaming test from RZ/G2L to PC,

First, open a terminal on Ubuntu 22.04, wait for receiving h.264 stream from RZ/G2L.

( PC )

```
gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5000 ! application/x-rtp,media=video,clock-rate=90000,encoding-name=H264,payload=96 ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! autovideosink

```

Below various test scripts are outlined for video streaming with increasing complexity, including decompression, processing, and compression steps.

You can use scripts and data under /test_env folder for test

1. mp4 video file > streaming

Please change the IP address and file name in the .sh script in the following,

run the script on RZ/G2L

```
run1.sh

```

or run the command below

```
gst-launch-1.0 -e filesrc location=./endo01.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! \
h264parse ! video/x-h264, stream-format=avc,alignment=au ! rtph264pay pt=96 name=pay0 \
config-interval=3 mtu=6000 ! udpsink host=192.168.0.105 port=5000

```

The result is as below,

1. mp4 video decompression > compression > streaming

tip

Two important Gstreamer elements used on Renesas RZ/G2L

h.264 decoder: omxh264dec h.264 encoder: omxh264enc

Please change the IP address and file name in the .sh script in the following,

run the script

```
run2.sh

```

or run the command below

```
gst-launch-1.0 -e filesrc location=./endo01.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! \

h264parse ! omxh264dec ! omxh264enc ! rtph264pay config-interval=10 ! udpsink host=192.168.0.105 port=5000

```

1. mp4 video decompression > image processing ( equirectangular ) > compression > streaming

Please change the IP address and file name in the .sh script in the following,

run the script

```
run3.sh

```

or run the command below

```
h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert ! omxh264enc !
rtph264pay config-interval=10 ! udpsink host=192.168.0.105 port=5000

```

tip

Since the execution speed is slower, some frames could be droped during the playback.

A longer mp4 test file would lead to better result.

1. mp4 video decompression > image processing ( equirectangular) > display

This test is simpler than the previous one. We can use it to compare the speed.

Please change the IP address and file name in the .sh script in the following,

run the script

```
run4.sh

```

or run the command below

```
gst-launch-1.0 -e filesrc location=./endo01.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! \
h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert !
 autovideosink

```

Result output:
